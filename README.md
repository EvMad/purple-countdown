# purple-countdown

This is a short JavaScript multiple choice quiz.

## About

I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. 

There is a 30 second timer which counts down as the client matches the terms to the descriptions.

## Usage

The "start" button will initiate a 30 second countdown. The Question button, and answer buttons, will generate a new question.
